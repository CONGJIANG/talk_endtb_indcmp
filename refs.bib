	abstract = {Meta-analysis, by synthesizing effect estimates from multiple studies conducted in diverse settings, stands at the top of the evidence hierarchy in clinical research. Yet, conventional approaches based on fixed- or random-effects models lack a causal framework, which may limit their interpretability and utility for public policy. Incorporating causal inference reframes meta-analysis as the estimation of well-defined causal effects on clearly specified populations, enabling a principled approach to handling study heterogeneity. We show that classical meta-analysis estimators have a clear causal interpretation when effects are measured as risk differences. However, this breaks down for nonlinear measures like the risk ratio and odds ratio. To address this, we introduce novel causal aggregation formulas that remain compatible with standard meta-analysis practices and do not require access to individual-level data. To evaluate real-world impact, we apply both classical and causal meta-analysis methods to 500 published meta-analyses. While the conclusions often align, notable discrepancies emerge, revealing cases where conventional methods may suggest a treatment is beneficial when, under a causal lens, it is in fact harmful.},

This paper treats a particular problem of generalizability, called "transportability," defined as a license to transfer causal effects learned in experimental studies to a new population, in which only observational studies can be conducted. We introduce a formal representation called "selection diagrams" for expressing knowledge about differences and commonalities between populations of interest and, using this representation, we reduce questions of transportability to symbolic derivations in the do-calculus. This reduction yields graph-based procedures for deciding, prior to observing any data, whether causal effects in the target population can be inferred from experimental findings in the study population. When the answer is affirmative, the procedures identify what experimental and observational findings need be obtained from the two populations, and how they can be combined to ensure bias-free transport.},

	abstract = {Externally controlled single-arm trials are critical to assess treatment efficacy across therapeutic indications for which randomized controlled trials are not feasible. A closely-related research design, the unanchored indirect treatment comparison, is often required for disconnected treatment networks in health technology assessment. We present a unified causal inference framework for both research designs. We develop a novel estimator that augments a popular weighting approach based on entropy balancing -- matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) -- by fitting a model for the conditional outcome expectation. The predictions of the outcome model are combined with the entropy balancing MAIC weights. While the standard MAIC estimator is singly robust where the outcome model is non-linear, our augmented MAIC approach is doubly robust, providing increased robustness against model misspecification. This is demonstrated in a simulation study with binary outcomes and a logistic outcome model, where the augmented estimator demonstrates its doubly robust property, while exhibiting higher precision than all non-augmented weighting estimators and near-identical precision to G-computation. We describe the extension of our estimator to the setting with unavailable individual participant data for the external control, illustrating it through an applied example. Our findings reinforce the understanding that entropy balancing-based approaches have desirable properties compared to standard ``modeling'' approaches to weighting, but should be augmented to improve protection against bias and guarantee double robustness.},

	abstract = {With increasing data availability, causal effects can be evaluated across different data sets, both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. RCTs isolate the effect of the treatment from that of unwanted (confounding) co-occurring effects but they may suffer from unrepresentativeness, and thus lack external validity. On the other hand, large observational samples are often more representative of the target population but can conflate confounding effects with the treatment of interest. In this paper, we review the growing literature on methods for causal inference on combined RCTs and observational studies, striving for the best of both worlds. We first discuss identification and estimation methods that improve generalizability of RCTs using the representativeness of observational data. Classical estimators include weighting, difference between conditional outcome models, and doubly robust estimators. We then discuss methods that combine RCTs and observational data to either ensure uncounfoundedness of the observational analysis or to improve (conditional) average treatment effect estimation. We also connect and contrast works developed in both the potential outcomes literature and the structural causal model literature. Finally, we compare the main methods using a simulation study and real world data to analyze the effect of tranexamic acid on the mortality rate in major trauma patients.

Such efforts are usually motivated by the desire to compare treatments evaluated in different studies -- for instance, through the introduction of external treatment groups -- or to estimate treatment effects with greater precision. Proposals to combine experimental studies with external data were made at least as early as the 1970s, but in recent years have come under increasing consideration by regulatory agencies involved in drug and device evaluation, particularly with the increasing availability of rich observational data. In this paper, we describe basic templates of study designs and data structures for combining information from experimental studies with external data, and use the potential (counterfactual) outcomes framework to elaborate identification strategies for potential outcome means and average treatment effects in these designs. In formalizing designs and identification strategies for combining information from experimental studies with external data, we hope to provide a conceptual foundation to support the systematic use and evaluation of such efforts.},

              via
              one or more common comparators. However, in some therapeutic areas, the evidence base can produce networks that are disconnected, in which there is neither direct evidence nor an indirect route for comparing certain treatments within the network. Disconnected networks may occur when there is no accepted standard of care, when there has been a major paradigm shift in treatment, when use of a standard of care or placebo is debated, when a product receives orphan drug designation, or when there is a large number of available treatments and many accepted standards of care. These networks pose a challenge to decision makers and clinicians who want to estimate the relative efficacy and safety of newly available agents against alternatives. A currently recommended approach is to insert a distribution for the unknown treatment effect(s) into a network meta‐analysis model of treatment effect. In this paper, we describe this approach along with two alternative Bayesian models that can accommodate disconnected networks. Additionally, we present a theoretical framework to guide the choice between modeling approaches. This paper presents researchers with the tools and framework for selecting appropriate models for indirect comparison of treatment efficacies when challenged with a disconnected framework.

Instead, we observe the outcome in multiple source populations and wish to combine the treatment effects therein to make inference on the TATE. In contrast to existing works that assume transportability on the conditional distribution of potential outcomes or conditional treatment-specific means, we work under a weaker form of effect transportability. Following the framework for causally interpretable meta-analysis, we assume transportability of conditional average treatment effects across multiple populations, which may hold with fewer standardization variables. Under this assumption, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound of the TATE and characterize a class of doubly robust and asymptotically linear estimators. Within this class, an efficient estimator assigns optimal weights to observations from different data sources. Additionally, we suggest estimators of a low-dimensional summary of effect heterogeneity in the target population. We illustrate the use of the proposed estimators on a multicentre weight management clinical trial for semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on overweight or obese patients. Using outcome information from other regions, we estimate the weight loss effect of semaglutide in the United States subgroup.},

In this work, we consider the general case where one or more data sources align with each part of the distribution of the target population, for example, the conditional distribution of the reward given actions and covariates. We describe potential gains in efficiency that can arise from fusing these data sources together in a single analysis, which we characterize by a reduction in the semiparametric efficiency bound. We also provide a general means to construct estimators that achieve these bounds. In numerical experiments, we illustrate marked improvements in efficiency from using our proposed estimators rather than their natural alternatives. Finally, we illustrate the magnitude of efficiency gains that can be realized in vaccine immunogenicity studies by fusing data from two HIV vaccine trials.},

	abstract = {While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are critical for establishing the efficacy of new therapies, there are limitations regarding what comparisons can be made directly from trial data. RCTs are limited to a small number of comparator arms and often compare a new therapeutic to a standard of care which has already proven efficacious. It is sometimes of interest to estimate the efficacy of the new therapy relative to a treatment that was not evaluated in the same trial, such as a placebo or an alternative therapy that was evaluated in a different trial. Such dual‐study comparisons are challenging because of potential differences between trial populations that can affect the outcome. In this article, two bridging estimators are considered that allow for comparisons of treatments evaluated in different trials, accounting for measured differences in trial populations. A “multi‐span” estimator leverages a shared arm between two trials, while a “single‐span” estimator does not require a shared arm. A diagnostic statistic that compares the outcome in the standardized shared arms is provided. The two estimators are compared in simulations, where both estimators demonstrate minimal empirical bias and nominal confidence interval coverage when the identification assumptions are met. The estimators are applied to data from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group 320 and 388 to compare the efficacy of two‐drug vs four‐drug antiretroviral therapy on CD4 cell counts among persons with advanced HIV. The single‐span approach requires weaker identification assumptions and was more efficient in simulations and the application.},

	abstract = {A fundamental principle of clinical medicine is that a treatment should only be administered to those patients who would benefit from it. Treatment strategies that assign treatment to patients as a function of their individual characteristics are known as dynamic treatment rules. The dynamic treatment rule that optimizes the outcome in the population is called the optimal dynamic treatment rule. Randomized clinical trials are considered the gold standard for estimating the marginal causal effect of a treatment on an outcome; they are often not powered to detect heterogeneous treatment effects, and thus, may rarely inform more personalized treatment decisions. The availability of multiple trials studying a common set of treatments presents an opportunity for combining data, often called data-fusion, to better estimate dynamic treatment rules. However, there may be a mismatch in the set of patient covariates measured across trials. We address this problem here; we propose a nonparametric estimator for the optimal dynamic treatment rule that leverages information across the set of randomized trials. We apply the estimator to fused randomized trials of medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder to estimate a treatment rule that would match patient subgroups with the medication that would minimize risk of return to regular opioid use.},

              Objectives
              Indirect comparisons via a common comparator (anchored comparisons) are commonly used in health technology assessment. However, common comparators may not be available, or the comparison may be biased due to differences in effect modifiers between the included studies. Recently proposed population adjustment methods aim to adjust for differences between study populations in the situation where individual patient data are available from at least one study, but not all studies. They can also be used when there is no common comparator or for single-arm studies (unanchored comparisons). We aim to characterise the use of population adjustment methods in technology appraisals (TAs) submitted to the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).
            
            
              Methods
              We reviewed NICE TAs published between 01/01/2010 and 20/04/2018.
            
            
              Results
              Population adjustment methods were used in 7 percent (18/268) of TAs. Most applications used unanchored comparisons (89 percent, 16/18), and were in oncology (83 percent, 15/18). Methods used included matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (89 percent, 16/18) and simulated treatment comparisons (17 percent, 3/18). Covariates were included based on: availability, expert opinion, effective sample size, statistical significance, or cross-validation. Larger treatment networks were commonplace (56 percent, 10/18), but current methods cannot account for this. Appraisal committees received results of population-adjusted analyses with caution and typically looked for greater cost effectiveness to minimise decision risk.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Population adjustment methods are becoming increasingly common in NICE TAs, although their impact on decisions has been limited to date. Further research is needed to improve upon current methods, and to investigate their properties in simulation studies.},

The former is the target trial, and the latter is the source trial. The identifiability of the target population average treatment effect often relies on conditional transportability assumptions. However, it is a common concern whether all relevant effect modifiers are measured and controlled for. We give a new proximal identification result in the presence of shifted, unobserved effect modifiers based on proxies: an adjustment proxy in both trials and an additional reweighting proxy in the source trial. We propose an estimator which is doubly-robust against misspecifications of the so-called bridge functions and asymptotically normal under mild consistency of estimators for the bridge functions. We use two weight management trials as a context to illustrate selection of proxies and apply our method to compare the weight loss effect of active treatments from these trials.},

	abstract = {Indirect comparisons of treatment-specific outcomes across separate studies often inform decision-making in the absence of head-to-head randomized comparisons. Differences in baseline characteristics between study populations may introduce confounding bias in such comparisons. Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) (Signorovitch et al., 2010) has been used to adjust for differences in observed baseline covariates when the individual patient-level data (IPD) are available for only one study and aggregate data (AGD) are available for the other study. The approach weights outcomes from the IPD using estimates of trial selection odds that balance baseline covariates between the IPD and AGD. With the increasing use of MAIC, there is a need for formal assessments of its statistical properties. In this paper we formulate identification assumptions for causal estimands that justify MAIC estimators. We then examine large sample properties and evaluate strategies for estimating standard errors without the full IPD from both studies. The finite-sample bias of MAIC and the performance of confidence intervals based on different standard error estimators are evaluated through simulations. The method is illustrated through an example comparing placebo arm and natural history outcomes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.},

            Network meta‐analysis (NMA) is an extension of pairwise meta‐analysis (PMA) which combines evidence from trials on multiple treatments in connected networks. NMA delivers internally consistent estimates of relative treatment efficacy, needed for rational decision making. Over its first 20 years NMA's use has grown exponentially, with applications in both health technology assessment (HTA), primarily re‐imbursement decisions and clinical guideline development, and clinical research publications. This has been a period of transition in meta‐analysis, first from its roots in educational and social psychology, where large heterogeneous datasets could be explored to find effect modifiers, to smaller pairwise meta‐analyses in clinical medicine on average with less than six studies. This has been followed by narrowly‐focused estimation of the effects of specific treatments at specific doses in specific populations in sparse networks, where direct comparisons are unavailable or informed by only one or two studies. NMA is a powerful and well‐established technique but, in spite of the exponential increase in applications, doubts about the reliability and validity of NMA persist. Here we outline the continuing controversies, and review some recent developments. We suggest that heterogeneity should be minimized, as it poses a threat to the reliability of NMA which has not been fully appreciated, perhaps because it has not been seen as a problem in PMA. More research is needed on the extent of heterogeneity and inconsistency in datasets used for decision making, on formal methods for making recommendations based on NMA, and on the further development of multi‐level network meta‐regression.},

Matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) is the most widely used covariate-adjusted indirect comparison method. MAIC has poor precision and is inefficient when the effective sample size after weighting is small. A modular extension to MAIC, termed two-stage matching-adjusted indirect comparison (2SMAIC), is proposed. This uses two parametric models. One estimates the treatment assignment mechanism in the study with individual patient data (IPD), the other estimates the trial assignment mechanism. The resulting weights seek to balance covariates between treatment arms and across studies. A simulation study provides proof-of-principle in an indirect comparison performed across two randomized trials and explores the use of weight truncation in combination with MAIC for the first time. Despite enforcing randomization and knowing the true treatment assignment mechanism in the IPD trial, 2SMAIC yields improved precision and efficiency with respect to MAIC in all scenarios, while maintaining similarly low levels of bias. The two-stage approach is effective when sample sizes in the IPD trial are low, as it controls for chance imbalances in prognostic baseline covariates between study arms. It is not as effective when overlap between the trials' target populations is poor and the extremity of the weights is high. In these scenarios, truncation leads to substantial precision and efficiency gains but induces considerable bias. The combination of a two-stage approach with truncation produces the highest precision and efficiency improvements.},

We consider identifiability conditions, derive implications of the conditions for the law of the observed data, and obtain identification results for transporting causal inferences from a collection of independent randomized trials to a new target population in which experimental data may not be available. We propose an estimator for the potential outcome mean in the target population under each treatment studied in the trials. The estimator uses covariate, treatment, and outcome data from the collection of trials, but only covariate data from the target population sample. We show that it is doubly robust in the sense that it is consistent and asymptotically normal when at least one of the models it relies on is correctly specified.

To leverage evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials in the generalizability context, we bridge the ideas from meta-analysis and causal inference. We integrate meta-analysis with causal inference approaches estimating target population average treatment effect. We evaluate the performance of the methods via simulation studies and apply the methods to generalize meta-analysis results from randomized controlled trials of treatments on schizophrenia to adults with schizophrenia who present to usual care settings in the United States. Our simulation results show that all methods perform comparably and well across different settings. The data analysis results show that the treatment effect in the target population is meaningful, although the effect size is smaller than the sample average treatment effect.

              Background
              Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been considered as the highest level of evidence in the pyramid of the evidence-based medicine. However, the causal interpretation of such results is seldom studied.
            
            
              Methods
              We systematically searched for methodologies pertaining to the implementation of a causally explicit framework for meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and discussed the interpretation and scientific relevance of such causal estimands. We performed a systematic search in four databases to identify relevant methodologies, supplemented with hand-search. We included methodologies that described causality under counterfactuals and potential outcomes framework.
            
            
              Results
              We only identified three efforts explicitly describing a causal framework on meta-analysis of RCTs. Two approaches required individual participant data, while for the last one, only summary data were required. All three approaches presented a sufficient framework under which a meta-analytical estimate is identifiable and estimable. However, several conceptual limitations remain, mainly in regard to the data generation process under which the selected RCTs rise.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We undertook a review of methodologies on causal inference methods in meta-analyses. Although all identified methodologies provide valid causal estimates, there are limitations in the assumptions regarding the data generation process and sampling of the potential RCTs to be included in the meta-analysis which pose challenges to the interpretation and scientific relevance of the identified causal effects. Despite both causal inference and meta-analysis being extensively studied in the literature, limited effort exists of combining those two frameworks.},

              Background
              Treatment of multidrug- and rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) is expensive, labour-intensive, and associated with substantial adverse events and poor outcomes. While most MDR/RR-TB patients do not receive treatment, many who do are treated for 18 months or more. A shorter all-oral regimen is currently recommended for only a sub-set of MDR/RR-TB. Its use is only conditionally recommended because of very low-quality evidence underpinning the recommendation. Novel combinations of newer and repurposed drugs bring hope in the fight against MDR/RR-TB, but their use has not been optimized in all-oral, shorter regimens. This has greatly limited their impact on the burden of disease. There is, therefore, dire need for high-quality evidence on the performance of new, shortened, injectable-sparing regimens for MDR-TB which can be adapted to individual patients and different settings.
            
            
              Methods
              endTB is a phase III, pragmatic, multi-country, adaptive, randomized, controlled, parallel, open-label clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of shorter treatment regimens containing new drugs for patients with fluoroquinolone-susceptible, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis. Study participants are randomized to either the control arm, based on the current standard of care for MDR/RR-TB, or to one of five 39-week multi-drug regimens containing newly approved and repurposed drugs. Study participation in all arms lasts at least 73 and up to 104 weeks post-randomization. Randomization is response-adapted using interim Bayesian analysis of efficacy endpoints. The primary objective is to assess whether the efficacy of experimental regimens at 73 weeks is non-inferior to that of the control. A sample size of 750 patients across 6 arms affords at least 80\% power to detect the non-inferiority of at least 1 (and up to 3) experimental regimens, with a one-sided alpha of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 12\%, against the control in both modified intention-to-treat and per protocol populations.
            
            
              Discussion
              The lack of a safe and effective regimen that can be used in all patients is a major obstacle to delivering appropriate treatment to all patients with active MDR/RR-TB. Identifying multiple shorter, safe, and effective regimens has the potential to greatly reduce the burden of this deadly disease worldwide.
