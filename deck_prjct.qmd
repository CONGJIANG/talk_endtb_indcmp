## MDR/RR-TB and HIV

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
- **Drug-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB)** remains a major global cause of preventable morbidity and mortality.
- People living with HIV (PLHIV) face substantially higher TB risk, and **TB is a leading cause of death among PLHIV**.
- Clinicians and programs need evidence to choose among **new all-oral regimens** in immunocompromised populations. 
:::


## New hope: shorter, all-oral MDR/RR-TB regimens

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
Recent trials introduced **short-course, all-oral regimens**:

- **TB-PRACTECAL** (Nyang’wa et al., 2022, 2024)  
  - 6-month regimen: **6BPaLM** (Bedaquiline + Pretomanid + Linezolid + Moxifloxacin)
  - Non-inferior vs standard care

- **endTB** (Guglielmetti et al., 2025)  
  - 9-month regimens: **9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, 9BDLLfxZ**
  - Non-inferior vs standard care

**Standard cares are** 

- TB-PRACTECAL: 9–12 or 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) 
- endTB: 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) 
:::

## The decision problem: no head-to-head evidence 

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
- WHO guidelines recommend multiple **all-oral** MDR/RR-TB regimens; shorter regimens are appealing for feasibility and adherence.
- However, **comparative evidence between 6-month and 9-month regimens is limited**, and certainty is often low.

:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f8f8f8; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #2e8b57;"}
**Question**: Is **6BPaLM** truly preferable to **9-month regimens**?
:::


## What data we have: two high-quality RCTs

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
We have individual patient data (IPD) from two non-inferiority RCTs:

| Feature | TB-PRACTECAL | endTB |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| **Duration** | 6-month regimens | 9-month regimens |
| **Standard care** | 9–12 or 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) | 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) |
| **Study regions** | Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southern Africa | South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa |
| **Primary outcome** | Composite unfavorable outcome | Favorable outcome |
| **Assessment time** | 72 weeks | 73 weeks |
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**But**:

1) **No head-to-head regimen comparison** (no common arm)  
2) **Heterogeneous standard care** (region/time-specific)  
3) **Population and setting differences** across trial regions (affects transportability)
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
Because a new head-to-head RCT is unlikely in the near term, we need to make the best possible use of existing evidence through cross-trial data fusion.
:::

## Aim and Approaches

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Primary aim**: Compare the efficacy of 6BPaLM versus each endTB regimen (9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, 9BDLLfxZ).

**Approaches**: 

  - **Meta-analytic** approach: apply **meta analysis** to estimate direct contrasts.
  - **Target trial emulation** approach: use target trial emulation framework (Hernán & Robins, 2016), then analysis as an observational study. 
  - **Pooled-IPD “direct” and "indirect" strategy**: Pool individual patient data (IPD) from both trials (direct and indirect method), as like apply to estimate direct contrast and the apply causaibility to estimate indirect contrast through standard care.

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**In this talk**, we will introduce four methodological strategies for data fusion in this cross-trial setting.
:::

## Method Review

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
:::

## Data Structure and Notation
::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
endTB trial $s = 1$ and TB-PRACTECAL trial $s = 2$ endTB trial $s = 1$ and TB-PRACTECAL trial and simple randome sapling from the target population $\Omega$ to each trial population $\Omega_{s=1}$ and $\Omega_{s=2}$.
:::

## Overview of four data fusion methods

::: {style="font-size: 80%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 3px; border-left: 3px solid #b22222;"}
Target population of interest $\Omega$: consisting of individuals at risk of TB recurrence in countries hosting enrollment sites for <span style="background-color:#FFF2CC">either the endTB or TB-PRACTECAL trials <span>.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}
$\Omega = \Omega_{s=1} \cup \Omega_{s=2},$ where $\Omega_{s=1}$ and $\Omega_{s=2}$ denote the target population of endTB and TB-PRACTECAL, respectively.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 75%;"}

| Method | Key Idea | Target Population |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| **(1) Meta-analytic Approach** | Compare each treatment v.s. its own control in each trial, then difference the effects | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
| **(2) Target trial emulation Approach** | Combine treatment arms, analyze as an observational study | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
| **(3) Direct Method** | Estimate direct contrast by pooling data and adjusting for trial differences | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
| **(4) Indirect Method** | Decompose contrast into treatment effect difference + control effect difference | $\Omega$ (Pooled) |
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
**All methods aim to estimate the casual estimand**: $$\psi(a, b) = \mathbb{E}[Y(a) - Y(b) \mid \Omega],$$ where $Y(a)$ denotes the potential outcome under the 6BPaLM regimen, $Y(b)$ denotes the potential outcome under an endTB regimen (9BLMZ, 9BCLLfxZ, or 9BDLLfxZ).
:::

<!-- . . .

::: {style="font-size: 80%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**Next**: We will examine each method in detail—their causal assumptions, statistical estimand, estimators, and implications for our cross-trial comparison.
::: -->

## (1A) Traditional approach: Separate trial analyses

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: Use randomization within each trial, then difference the estimated effects.

What the traditional approach does:

1.  **Analyze each trial separately**: Calculate within trial effect with data from TB-PRACTECAL
    and endTB separately.
2.  **Compare the two results**: Take the difference between the two trial-specific effects.

**Strength**: Uses randomization

**Limitation**: Assume both endTB and TB-PRACTECAL has same control arm 
:::


## (1B) Observational Study Approach: Combine treatment arms

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: Ignore control groups and directly compare people who received different treatments.

What the observational approach does:

1.  **Keep only treated participants**: keep people who received 6BPaLM and endTB regimen.
2.  **Combine treated patients into one dataset**: Everyone in this dataset received an active treatment
3. **Adjust for differences between patients**
3. **Compare outcomes**: Differences are attributed to treatment, after adjustment

**key**: We gain simplicity and efficiency by pooling treated arms, but we no longer use randomization—identification relies entirely on covariate adjustment. 
:::


## Method (2): Direct and Indirect Fusion Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**: What if we could combine data from both trials into one large dataset and then compare the treatments as if it were one big observational study?

That’s exactly what the Direct Fusion Method does:

1.  **Merge the Data**: Pool individual patient data from TB-PRACTECAL and endTB.
2.  **Treat as One Study**: Ignore which trial each patient came from, and directly compare 6BPaLM vs. the 9-month regimens.
3.  **Adjust for Differences**: Since this isn’t a randomized experiment, we use statistical methods (like weighting) to “balance” the treatment groups and make the comparison fair.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**key**: Pretend we have one large observational study with patients on either 6BPaLM or a 9-month regimen, then statistically adjust to make the groups comparable.
:::

## Method (2B): Direct Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 1: Consistency**
If an individual actually receives treatment $a$, then their observed outcome $Y$ is equal to their potential outcome $Y(a)$. This implicitly assumes that there are no multiple versions of the treatment, no interference.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 2: Exchangeability (unconfoundedness)**

After we account for all important patient characteristics (age, disease severity, HIV status, etc.), **treatment assignment is unrelated to what outcomes would have been under different treatments**.

<span style="background-color:#FFF2CC">Can be ganrentted by randomization within each trial. </span>
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 3: Transportability**: $Y(a),Y(b)\perp\!\!\perp S\mid L$

Information from patients on 6BPaLM in TB-PRACTECAL can tell us what would happen if endTB patients took 6BPaLM, and vice versa.

**Explanation**: What we learn about a treatment in one trial can be applied to patients in the other trial.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
The patient populations from the two trials must be similar enough in important characteristics that we can safely "borrow" information across them. *If the trials studied very different types of patients, this method will fail.*
:::

## Key Assumptions (cts)
::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 4: Positivity — Treatment assignment**

Within each trial, everyone must have a real chance to receive each treatment.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Key Assumption 5: Positivity — Trial participation/inclusion**

Across trials, everyone must have a real chance to be in either trial. 

No group of patients should exist only in one trial and never the other.

If a certain kind of patient (say very sick patients) can only ever appear in trial 1 and never in trial 2, then we cannot use trial 2 to learn about that type of patient.
:::


## Identification Result (Statistical Estimand)

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
Identification of the parameter of interest $\psi$
\begin{align}\label{psiid}
\psi(a, b) &:=  \mathbb{E}[Y(a) - Y(b) \mid \Omega] \nonumber \\
    &= \mathbb{E}_{L\mid S=1}[\mathbb{E}(Y \mid A = a, L, S =1)] \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S=1) \\ &\ \ \ \ + \mathbb{E}_{L\mid S=2}[\mathbb{E}(Y \mid A = a, L, S =1)] \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S=2) \nonumber \\ &\ \ \ \ - \mathbb{E}_{L\mid S=1}[\mathbb{E}(Y \mid A = b, L, S =2)] \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S=1)  \\ &\ \ \ \ - \mathbb{E}_{L\mid S=2}[\mathbb{E}(Y \mid A = b, L, S =2)] \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S=2),
\end{align}
where $S=1$ indicates TB-PRACTECAL and $S=2$ indicates endTB.

or equivalently, $\psi$ can be identified as the following IPW form
\begin{align}\label{psiid2}
\psi(a, b) &:=  \mathbb{E}[Y(a) - Y(b) \mid \Omega] \nonumber \\
&= 
\mathbb{E}\!\left[\frac{\mathbb{I}(A=a)\mathbb{I}(S=1)Y}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(A=a \mid L, S=1)}\right]
+ \mathbb{E}\!\left[\frac{\mathbb{I}(A=a)\mathbb{I}(S=1)Y\, \delta(L)}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(A=a \mid L, S=1)}\right] \nonumber \\
&\quad - \mathbb{E}\!\left[\frac{\mathbb{I}(A=b)\mathbb{I}(S=2)Y\, \delta^{-1}(L)}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(A=b \mid L, S=2)}\right]- \mathbb{E}\!\left[\frac{\mathbb{I}(A=b)\mathbb{I}(S=2)Y}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(A=b \mid L, S=2)}\right],
\end{align}
where $\delta(L):=
\frac{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 2 \mid L)}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 1 \mid L)} = \frac{1 - \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 1 \mid L)}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 1 \mid L)}.$
:::



## Estimation

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
We implement the Direct Method using three estimation method (1) **g-computation** (2) **IPW** and (3) **one-step/doubly-robust estimation**:

**Doubly-Robust**: The one-step estimator is consistent if either the outcome model or the inclusion and treatment model is correctly specified.

1. **Outcome Model**: Predicts what the outcome    would be under each treatment, given patient characteristics, $\mu_s(z, L) = \E(Y\mid L,A=z,S=s)$ for any $(s, z) \in \{(1, a), (2, b)\}.$

2. **Inclusion and Treatment Model**: The trial inclusion (i.e., $g(L) := \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S=1\mid L)$) and treatment mechanism (i.e., $\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(A=z\mid L,S=s)$) are consistently estimated.

Statistical properities of one-step estimator, such as consistency and asymptotic normality, are established under standard regularity conditions.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
Treatment mechanism are known in randomized trials, so only the <span style="background-color:#FFF2CC">inclusion model and outcome model </span> need to be estimated "well", and the doubly-robust property ensures consistency if either is correct (see Appendix for the 2nd order remainder term).
:::

## Strengths & Weaknesses

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Strengths**: 

- **Intuitive**: Directly compares the treatments of interest—easy to explain to clinicians. 
- **Uses All Data**: Leverages all treatment arms from both trials. 
- **Doubly Robust**: More reliable, less sensitive to model misspecification. 
- **Efficient**: Good statistical power, works well even with moderate sample sizes.
- **Use Randomization**: Implicitly use the fact that the original trials were randomized.

**Challenges & Limitations**: 

- **Assumptions**: Transportability may not hold if trial populations differ substantially.  
:::

. . .


## Summary: Direct Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
The Direct Method lets us “directly compare” treatments that were never tested head-to-head in the same trial, by combining trial data and applying advanced statistical adjustment.

**For Our Research**: This is **one of the most straightforward and robust approaches** to answer whether 6BPaLM is preferable to 9-month regimens for people living with HIV, provided the trial populations are sufficiently similar.
:::


## Method (2A): Indirect Method – decomposition for adjusting differing standard care

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**The Core Idea**:
Instead of directly comparing 6BPaLM vs. 9-month regimens, we break the problem into **two parts**:

1. **The difference in treatment effects**  
   How much better is 6BPaLM vs. *its* standard care, compared to how much better a 9-month regimen is vs. *its* standard care?

2. **The difference in standard care**  
   How different are the two standard care treatments themselves?
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**Simple formula**:  
Total difference = (Treatment effect difference) + (Standard care difference)

**Mathematically**:  
$$\psi(a, b)= \theta + \phi $$ 
where $\theta := \mathbb{E}[Y(a)-Y(c_1)\mid\Omega] - \mathbb{E}[Y(b)-Y(c_2)\mid\Omega]$, difference in treatment effects,
and $\phi := \mathbb{E}[Y(c_1)-Y(c_2)\mid\Omega],$ the difference between the two standard care arms.
:::

## The Two Components: A Closer Look
::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

- **Component 1: Treatment Effect Difference ($\theta$)**
  - In **TB-PRACTECAL**: 6BPaLM v.s. Standard Care 1
  - In **endTB**: 9-month regimen v.s. Standard Care 2
  - Captures how much better each investigational regimen is compared to its own control, i.e., $\theta := \mathbb{E}[Y(a)-Y(c_1)\mid\Omega] - \mathbb{E}[Y(b)-Y(c_2)\mid\Omega]$

 - $(\text{Effect of 6BPaLM vs. SC1}) - (\text{Effect of 9-month regimen vs. SC2})$
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
- **Component 2: Standard Care Difference ($\phi$)**
  - Direct comparison: Standard Care 1 vs. Standard Care 2
  - Captures differences in background treatment across trials

- $\phi := \mathbb{E}[Y(c_1)-Y(c_2)\mid\Omega]$
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
**Fact of Component 2**:  
We can estimate $\phi$ using the **Direct Method** from before, since $\phi := \mathbb{E}\left[ Y(c_1) - Y(c_2) \mid \Omega \right]$ coincides with the pairwise contrast $\phi = \psi(c_1, c_2)$. 
:::

## Identification Assumptions (for $\theta$ and $\phi$)

- **(A1) Consistency**  

- **(A2) Exchangeability within each trial**  
  - Trial 1: $Y(a), Y(c_1)\perp\!\!\perp A \mid L,S=1$  
  - Trial 2: $Y(b), Y(c_2)\perp\!\!\perp A \mid L,S=2$

- **(A3) Positivity of treatment within trial**  

  Everyone in each trial has a non-zero chance to receive every treatment arm.

- **(A4) Transportability** : $Y(a),Y(c_1), Y(b), Y(c_2)\perp\!\!\perp S \mid L$

- **(A5) Positivity of trial inclusion**  

  For any covariate profile $L$, a subject must have a chance to be in both trials.




## Identification of $\theta$

Decomposing $\theta := \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[Y(a) - Y(c_1) \mid \Omega]}_{\theta_1} - \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[Y(b) - Y(c_2) \mid \Omega]}_{\theta_2},$ we have: for $\theta_1$
\begin{align}\label{thetaid}
\mathbb{E}_{L \mid S = 1}& \left[ \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = a, L, S = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = c_1, L, S = 1] \right] \mathbb{P}(S = 1)  \nonumber \\
+ \mathbb{E}_{L \mid S = 2} &\left[ \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = a, L, S = 1] - \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A = c_1, L, S = 1] \right] \mathbb{P}(S = 2)
\end{align}

or equivalently, $\theta_1$ can be identified as the following IPW form,
\begin{align*}
&\mathbb{E}\!\left[\frac{\mathbb{I}(A=a)\mathbb{I}(S=1)Y}{\mathbb{P}(A=a \mid L, S=1)} - \frac{\mathbb{I}(A=c_1)\mathbb{I}(S=1)Y\, }{\mathbb{P}(A=c_1 \mid L, S=1)}\right] \\ +& \mathbb{E}\!\left[\frac{\mathbb{I}(A=a)\mathbb{I}(S=1)Y\, \delta(L)}{\mathbb{P}(A=a \mid L, S=1)} - \frac{\mathbb{I}(A=c_1)\mathbb{I}(S=1)Y\delta(L)}{\mathbb{P}(A=c_1 \mid L, S=1)}\right]
\end{align*}

where $\delta(L):=
\frac{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 2 \mid L)}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 1 \mid L)} = \frac{1 - \mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 1 \mid L)}{\mathbb{P}_{\Omega}(S = 1 \mid L)}.$

  <span style="background:#E6F7FF">
  There are 4 terms in the above identification formulas, corresponding to 2 components across 2 trials.
  </span>


## How It Works: Combining the Pieces
::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
- **Step 1: Estimate Standard Care Difference**, $\hat{\phi}$
  - Use the Direct Method to compare SC1 v.s. SC2

- **Step 2: Estimate Treatment Effect Difference,** $\hat{\theta}$
  - Estimate 6BPaLM effect v.s. SC1 in TB-PRACTECAL, and 9-month effect vs. SC2 in endTB
  - Transport these effects to the combined population (4 terms in the identification formula)


- **Step 3: Add Them Up**
$\hat{\psi}(a, b)$ = $\hat{\theta}$ + $\hat{\phi}$
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
**In Estimation**, we also proposed hree estimation method (1) **g-computation** (2) **IPW** and (3) **one-step/doubly robust estimation** to estimate both components and combine them for the final contrast. Statistical properities such as consistency and asymptotic normality are established under standard regularity conditions.
:::

## Strengths & Weaknesses

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

- **Strengths**
  - **Explicitly handles different standard cares** — a major advantage
  - **Uses randomization where possible** — more credible treatment effect estimates
  - **Flexible assumptions** — weaker assumptions for the standard care comparison

- **Challenges**
  - **More complex** — requires estimating two components (8 total key terms)
  - **Multiple assumptions** — each component has its own requirements

:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #e6f7ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #0077b6;"}
When standard care differs substantially between trials, this method **explicitly accounts for that difference**, making it potentially more accurate than the traditional approach.
:::


## Summary: Indirect Method

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

The Indirect Method breaks the comparison into "how much better the treatments are than their respective standard cares" plus "how different those standard cares are from each other."

**The Key Insight**:  
By separating treatment effects from background care differences, we get a clearer picture of what is really driving any observed differences between 6BPaLM and 9-month regimens.
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #4682b4;"}
**For Our Study**:  
This method is particularly valuable because TB-PRACTECAL and endTB had different standard care regimens—something we can't ignore when comparing their results.
:::

## Key differences between trials

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
| Feature | TB-PRACTECAL | endTB |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|------------------|
| **Duration** | 6-month regimens | 9-month regimens |
| **Standard care** | 9–12 or 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) | 18–20 month all-oral regimens (region-specific) |
| **Study regions** | Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southern Africa | South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa |
| **Primary outcome** | Composite unfavorable outcome | Favorable outcome |
| **Assessment time** | 72 weeks | 73 weeks |
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**Critical implication**: 

- Standard care differs **both across regions and over time** 
- Direct comparison is **not straightforward** due to differing controls 
:::

## Challenges for cross-trial data fusion

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}
**1. No head-to-head comparison** - Trials compared regimens to **different standard-of-care arms** - No common treatment arm between trials

**2. Heterogeneity in standard care** - Standard care varied by country and enrollment period - Changes in WHO guidelines during trial periods

**3. Regional and population differences** - Limited overlap in study regions - Different background epidemiology, healthcare systems
:::

. . .

::: {style="font-size: 85%; background-color: #fff0f0; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #b22222;"}
**We need causal data fusion methods** that can: 

- Combine IPD from both trials 
- Account for differing standard care 
- Estimate direct contrasts between investigational regimens
